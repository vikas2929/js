        What JavaScript do ?
    </h1>
    <p>
        After reading this module, you will be very sure whether you should jump into JavaScript deeply or not.



JavaScript allows you to make your web page more interactive by accessing and modifying the HTML content or CSS style.


For example whenever your website visitor subscribes, likes or comments, you are able to send a Thank You message to the visitor instantly without loading the entire page.


That’s not all, you can do lots of amazing things with JavaScript. 


Let’s take a look at what you can do with JavaScript 





1. JavaScript can change HTML content

You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page and modify them.



For example you can use JavaScript to select “h1” tag by its id or class attribute or tag itself (if you are just starting with JavaScript then don’t worry about how we can select tags) and write  inside ‘h1’ tag what you want. Here is code for do that 




Basic Understanding of JavaScript

getElementById is used to select a tag by it's "Id" attribute

innerHTML is used to put content in a HTML tag

onclick is a 'event' we will cover it later (basic meaning is when someone click on button the action happens which is assigned to onclick event in this case 's content is changing to Hello World! )

document is a object we will cover it later in tutorial





NOTE 1  If you are just starting don’t worry that you aren't getting anything.



NOTE 2 Please copy this code and run it on your browser.



In the browser you can see a “Click Me!” button there, when you press it you will see that‘s content is changed to Hello World!







2. JavaScript can change CSS style

Before starting take a quick look at code



Basic Understanding of JavaScript
Now you can understand that we have selected  tag.
style is object with content all CSS properties.
After style you can any CSS property along with it's value as above format.
NOTE  Paste the code into you IDE and run it and comment me what you see.

3. JavaScript can change attributes' value
Before starting take a quick look at code


Basic Understanding of JavaScript

We select  tag by it's Id attribute and change it's 'src' attribute from Img_1 to Img_2
NOTE  Paste code to your IDE and run it (Before running it make sure you add img's paths to your directory) then comment me what results you get.



These are the basic things that JavaScript can do, there are a lot of more amazing things that  JavaScript can do. You will gradually get understand during this course.

Here is the end of my first topic of JavaScript tutorial. I hope it helps you to get a overview of JavaScript.
